# Integrated TradeX Setup

To properly set up the integrated TradeX platform, follow these steps:

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. If you encounter styling issues:
   - Make sure Tailwind CSS is properly installed
   - Verify that the postcss.config.js and tailwind.config.js files exist
   - Check that index.css has the proper Tailwind directives

## Common Issues

If the page is not properly styled:
1. Try clearing your browser cache
2. Make sure all dependencies are installed correctly
3. Check the browser console for any CSS loading errors

The landing page should have a blue gradient background and proper styling. If you're seeing unstyled content, there might be an issue with the Tailwind CSS configuration or loading.
